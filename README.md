1. Output, Your first program
2. Data types, primitive data types/variables
3. Input/Output
4. If, statement, blocks, comments
5. If-else, switch
6. while, do while, for loops
7. Methods/Functions
8. Basic data structures **(Optional)**
9. File I/O, try catch exception **(Optional)**
10. GUI development **(Optional)**

### Hour 1: Introduction and Setup

- Introduce the team and give a brief overview of the course.
- Explain what programming is and why learning Java is beneficial, limitless resources online.
- Discuss the basic concepts of programming: algorithms, variables, and control structures.
- Go through use of JDK and IDE, but currently will be using [online java compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler).
- If not installing IDE, at least install java sdk to run `javac/java` command.

### Hour 2: Java Basics

- Introduce the basic syntax of Java and explain the structure of a Java program.
- Discuss data types, variables, and constants.
- Explain how to perform arithmetic operations in Java.
- Introduce input and output using the Scanner class.

### Hour 3: Control Structures & Functions

- Explain the concept of control structures (if statements, loops, and switch statements) and their importance in programming.
- Walk through the syntax and usage of if statements for decision-making.
- Demonstrate loops (for, while, and do-while) and their applications.
- Discuss the switch statement for multi-way decision-making.
- Discuss the syntax of naming conventions, defining and calling functions in Java.
- Provide examples and exercises for students to practice using control structures.

### Hour 4: Quiz and Summary Recap
- Conduct Quiz with prizes.
- Discuss future use case of Java (OOP, Web/Mobile/Desktop enterprise software development, Financial system). 
- Throughout the class, encourage students to ask questions (QnA) and provide hands-on exercises or coding challenges to reinforce the concepts taught.
- Outro with programming advices - ways to learn code (Hackathon, collaboration).

**Notes/Advices:** 
1. Emphasize that use of ChatGPT, online resources, project-based learning, open-source contribution for skillset improvement and better career opportunities. 
2. Emphasize the importance of planning, drafting out approach for big projects before coding.
3. Differences between programming and coding.
3. Company code SOPs, consideration of performance, readability, modularity, scalability, error handling, etc.
